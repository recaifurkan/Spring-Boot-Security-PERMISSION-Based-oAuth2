# Spring-Boot-Security-PERMISSION-Based-oAuth2
A Spring Boot 2.2 reference implementation that demonstrates how to secure REST APIs with a classic OAuth2 Authorization Server, JWT token store, and fine-grained permission checks on each endpoint. The project focuses on showing how roles aggregate permissions and how those permissions are enforced via `@PreAuthorize` expressions.
